# Create rooms, songs and guests
# Check in guests to rooms/Check out guests from rooms
# Add songs to rooms
#10 max per room
#more guests trying to be checked in than there is free space in the room?
# an entry fee - So the guests could have money so they can pay it.
# Guests could have a favourite song, and if their favourite song is on the room's playlist, they can cheer loudly! (return a string like "Whoo!")
# Rooms can keep track of the entry fees/spending of the guests - maybe add a bar tab/bar class?
# Add anything extra you think would be good to have at a karaoke venue!
